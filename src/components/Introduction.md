Hey there, I'm Daniel Pereira and I'm currently a final year Software Engineering student at [_University of Minho_](https://www.uminho.pt/EN/). 

I'm a true technology enthusiast at heart. If you catch me, I'm probably elbow-deep in neovim, most likely breaking some stuff, and other than vim, I'm also a big fan of the Elixir programming language. 

<br/>

At Uni I've always tried to be active outside of my course work. I've been part of [_CeSIUM_](https://cesium.pt/) (Software Engineering Students Association of UMinho) where I've contributed to the development of open source projects and also helped organize events for the student community.

<br/>

When I'm out there in the real world, you can find me surfing, practicing Jiu-Jitsu, playing some games or just hanging out with friends.
