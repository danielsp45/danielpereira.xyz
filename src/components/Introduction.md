I'm Daniel Pereira and I'm currently a first year Computer Science and Engineering masters student at [_University of Minho_](https://www.uminho.pt/EN/). 

<br/>

I'm a true technology enthusiast at heart with a big interest for distributed systems and storage systems. If you catch me, I'm probably elbow-deep in neovim, most likely breaking some stuff, and other than vim, I'm also a big fan of the Elixir programming language. 

<br/>

At Uni I've always tried to be active outside of my course work. I've been part of [_CeSIUM_](https://cesium.pt/) (Software Engineering Students Association of UMinho) where I've contributed to the development of open source projects and also helped organize events for the student community and I'm also an active researcher at the [**Distributed Storage Group**](https://dsr-haslab.github.io/) research center.

<br/>

When I'm out there in the real world, you can find me running, practicing Jiu-Jitsu, playing some games or just hanging out with friends.
