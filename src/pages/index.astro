                I tinker with technology for fun (and sometimes research). My main interests revolve around <span class="italic">distributed systems</span> and <span class="italic">storage systems</span>. If you spot me, Iâ€™m probably lost in Neovim - either getting stuff done or breaking code. Iâ€™m also pretty obsessed with the <span class="italic">Elixir</span> programming language.

                At university, I like keeping busy outside of lectures. Iâ€™ve been part of <a class="text-orange-500" href="https://cesium.pt/">CeSIUM</a> (Software Engineering Students Association of UMinho), where I contributed to open-source projects and helped organize events for the student community. On the research side, Iâ€™m part of the <a class="text-orange-500" href="https://dsr-haslab.github.io/">Distributed Storage Group</a> at HASLab.

                When Iâ€™m not wrestling with code, youâ€™ll probably find me running, practicing Jiu-Jitsu, gaming, or just hanging out with friends.
