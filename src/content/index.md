Hey there, I'm Daniel Pereira and I'm a final year Software Engineering student at _University of Minho_.
Throughout my academic journey, I've actively engaged in diverse forms of associativism, contributing my passion and skills to initiatives such as _CeSIUM_ and _CoderDojo Braga_.

<br/>

During my academic course work I've been exposed to various fields of software engineering such as **Algorithms and Data Structures**, **Computer Networking**, **Formal Methods**, **Distributed Systems**, **Cibersecurity** and much more.

<br/>

As I said before, I've also been active outside of my university course work.

During my time at CeSIUM, I began as a Co-Director of the Pedagogical Department, tasked with fostering seamless communication between students and professors, while also spearheading the organization of educational workshops.
Transitioning into my second year at CeSIUM, I joined CAOS (Development Department), where I played role in the development and maintenance of CeSIUM's repositories, while collaborating closely with a dynamic team of five people.

At CoderDojo, I started as a Mentor, teaching kids aged 7-17 programming. Later, I took on the role of Mentor and Tech Platform Responsible, where I developed, maintained, and deployed tech platforms for CoderDojo Braga.
